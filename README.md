## Hey!!! What are you doing here?

If you are reading this I'm assuming that you are reaching the end of your PhD and you're at the stage where you're trying to get it in one consistent piece of work. Although it can also mean that you like to anticipate in structuring your work... Either way congratulation on reaching that stage.
In case you're not sure how you got here in the first place, you're not at all interested in writing a PhD thesis or you have no idea what the heck LaTeX is, you should know that being curious and interested is a very valuable skill, however, it is probably time that you get back to work now :)

## What is *this*?

*This* is a LaTeX template for PhD theses at Wageningen University. It is particularly applicable to theses submitted to the [PE&RC](https://www.pe-rc.nl/) graduate school, I'm not sure what other graduate schools theses look like, so you might want to double check that before you start using this template. Otherwise just throw the text in the files, compile, and you'll have a beautiful looking thesis (it's almost that easy).

## Acknowledgements

[Arend Ligtenberg](https://www.wageningenur.nl/en/Persons/Arend-Ligtenberg.htm) from the Laboratory of Geo-Information Science and Remote Sensing (Wageningen University) is the main person behind this template. He designed the whole thing in 2006 for his own [thesis](http://edepot.wur.nl/40696). Minor adjustments were made by Kim Calders (2014), Ben deVries (2015) and myself. Big thanks to them.

Good luck finalizing your thesis,
